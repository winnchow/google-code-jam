# Google code jam kickstart
## Here you can find my solutions to Google code jam kickstart questions.
### I used Jupyter notebooks to solve them so that you can easily run them on your own. I also documented my solution to explain the logic and thinking behind. Feel free to use them for your own learning. If you think you can improve my solutions, please let me know. I like collaboration. 
### Email me, winnchow@gmail.com, if you have questions. Happy learning.
