# Google code jam
## Here you can find my solutions to Google code jam kickstart questions.
### I used Jupyter notebooks to solve them so that you can easily run them on your own. I also documented my solution to explain my thinking behind them. Feel free to use them for your own learning. If you think you can improve my solutions, please let me know.
### Email me if you have questions. Happy learning.
